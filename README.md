## HEEUP v.s. [1] in energy saving.

In order to compare the energy-saving performance of the two, we performed EnergyPlus energy consumption simulation on the land use configuration generated by the respective strategies of HEEUP and [1].

Energy savings are measured based on a percentage improvement from the original land use configuration (real-world).

Energy Savings Percentage = $\frac{y - \hat{y}}{y} \times 100\\% $
in:
- $y$ represents the energy consumption of the original land use configuration.
- $\hat{y}$ represents the energy consumption generated by the model.
  
where positive values ​​indicate improved energy savings and negative values ​​indicate lower performance than the original configuration. We run five independent experiments (Exp.), and  present the results in the table below. The energy saving of our method HEEUP is more than 9x and 19x over [1] in two cities. HEEUP significantly outperforms the [1] strategy in terms of energy saving. This result clearly demonstrates the significant advantages of HEEUP in improving energy efficiency in optimizing urban layout.

**Table : Comparison of energy efficiency of HEEUP vs. [1]**

- **HEEUP** adopts a hierarchical, energy-saving optimization approach, progressing from Urban Structure -> Generate Land Use Configuration -> Adjust Building Design Parameters. Combine spatial attributes to carry out planning at all levels of decision-making to minimize energy consumption under reasonable layout.
- **[1]** employs a sequential decision-making model, addressing urban complexities and spatial planning needs. The urban identity is based on dynamic adaptation with a comprehensive reward system aimed at enhancing service delivery, ecological sustainability and transport efficiency.

In essence, HEEUP is engineered for energy optimization within urban layouts. While [1] multifaceted strategy to meet diverse urban service demands through adaptive spatial planning.
The results prove that HEEUP shows obvious advantages in promoting energy conservation.
